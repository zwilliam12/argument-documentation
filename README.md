## Documentation website

All documentation is automatically generated using [MkDocs][2] and hosted on a Github pages website.
The documentation is stored in the [docs/][3] directory of this repository.
Any and all changes to the documentation must be made to the files in that folder.
Additionally, the [configuration file][4] for [MkDocs][2] must be updated as necessary for any changes.
